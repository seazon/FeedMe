FeedMe now supports TTS and podcast, you can read articles with your ear.

- For podcast feed, FeedMe supports manual download for offline reading.
- For normal feed, FeedMe compliances with the standard Android TTS specification, you can read with your favorite TTS engine, such as Google TTS or Ivona.

FeedMe integrates these two different forms, and you can listen all items like listening to music.

FeedMe provides play section into the playlist in the left navigation bar. To simplify the logic, FeedMe has only one playlist.
