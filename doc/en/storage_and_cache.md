Since version 3.13, FeedMe is compatible with the storage mechanism of Android 10.

###### Storage permissions
No longer requires storage permissions for Android 10+. FeedMe will prompt for authorization if storage access fails for Android 9 and below.

###### Article cache
Prior to the new version, FeedMe allowed to customize the cache location, but during the compatible adaptation process, due to some problems, the cached images could not be displayed on the article page, so the new version does not support the customization of the cache location currently.

If a custom location was set, the default cache location will be automatically used after updating the new version, so a synchronization is required.

###### Settings backup and restore
No longer save to FeedMe preset path, you can choose where to save the backup. Similarly, when you are ready to restore the settings, you need to enter the path where the backup file saved and restore.

###### Articles are saved as HTML files
No longer save to FeedMe preset path, you can choose where to save the backup.

###### save Picture
No longer save to the preset path of FeedMe, all picture will save to the public picture directory.

###### Save feeds in batches
This feature is removed in the new version.
