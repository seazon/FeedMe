Starting from 3.0.3, FeedMe supports blocking images by long-pressing the images in the article list. The blocked images will no longer be downloaded and displayed. 

The purpose of this feature is to block duplicate, irrelevant pictures in the feed.

###### features
- Add up to `32` images, as too many will affect synchronization speed. If you continue to add, the first added will be removed.
- You only need to add the same image once, and FeedMe will recognize and block images with different links but the same content.
- Support regular expressions. (New in version 3.13)
- Added `Blocking Images` menu in the article list. You can view, update or delete the added images. (New in version 3.13)
