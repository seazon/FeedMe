# Adapted to E-INK
- 1. `Settings` - `Interface` - `Theme` - set to `E-Ink` **Pure black and white for better display**
- 2. `Settings` - `Control` - Turn on `Split Action Bar` **Put the action bar on the side (tablet) / bottom (mobile phone), you can better operate the menu**
- 3. Enter the article list page - Long press the title bar at the top - Pop up the `Edit Menu` - Move the default disabled `Back`, `Up`, `Down` to the top, save **Tap menu instead swipe gesture**
- 4. Enter the article detail page - Long press the title bar at the top - Pop up the `Edit Menu` - Move the default disabled `Back`, `Up`, `Down` to the top, save **Tap menu instead swipe gesture**

# Others
In `Settings` - `Lab`, there is an `E-Ink Screen Optimization`, which can reduce the screen flicker of the article page after it is turned on, but the menu is not available.
